# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide for Barracks Media Frontend

## Quick Start - GitHub to Netlify Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `barracks-media-frontend`
3. Make it public or private (your choice)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Upload Your Code
Since you're working in a development environment, you have two options:

#### Option A: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. Download all project files from this environment
2. Go to your new GitHub repository
3. Click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag and drop all your project files
5. Commit the files

#### Option B: Use Git Commands (if you have Git locally)

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Barracks Media Frontend"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/barracks-media-frontend.git
